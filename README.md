## A todo list
Todo is an application created on Ruby on Rails, where you can keep the most important task you do not want to forget.
It is the second project created while I am attending the WDI-15 in General Assembly in Sydney.

## Frameworks and Libraries

* Ruby on Rails (v4.2.6).
* HTML.
* Sass.
* Bootstrap.
* JavaScript.

## Approach

I created the application using Postgres database. I added some gems and also an API to send emails to the new users called SenGrid.

The CRUD has 3 models: Users, Lists and Tasks, and nested routes between Lists and Tasks.

## Future Additions

- Facebook login.
- Twitter login.
- User profile page.
- User to be able to change the password.
- Add dates to the tasks and the lits.
